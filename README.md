## Quick Start
1. Setup your MDM server - either [MicroMDM](https://micromdm.io) or [NanoMDM](https://github.com/micromdm/nanomdm)
2. Setup the backend server - deployment guide is found at [backend/README.md](https://github.com/jefferyabbott/Xavier/blob/main/backend/README.md)
3. Setup the frontend web site - deployment guide is found at [frontend/README.md](https://github.com/jefferyabbott/Xavier/blob/main/frontend/README.md)

## User Accounts
Xavier will eventually support SAML authentication. For now, as a new project, it only supports local user accounts. There are two types of accounts: administrator (can do anything) and auditor (read-only, cannot do anything). See the deployment guide for the backend in order to setup your first administrator account.

## Recommended Architecture
details coming soon (the official launch is December 15, 2023)
